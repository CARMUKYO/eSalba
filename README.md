# eSalba - Community Environmental Monitoring Web App

## Introduction
Environmental issues such as pollution, deforestation, and waste management are pressing concerns that affect communities worldwide. There is a growing need for a platform that empowers citizens to report and address these issues collaboratively. This project aims to develop a **Community Environmental Monitoring Web App** that allows users to report environmental problems, visualize data on a map, and engage with the community to find solutions.

## Objectives
### General Objective:
To create a user-friendly web application that enables community members to monitor and report local environmental issues.

### Specific Objectives:
- To provide a platform for users to report environmental issues with descriptions, photos, and geolocation.
- To visualize reported issues on an interactive map for easy identification of problem areas.
- To facilitate community interaction through comments and discussions on reported issues.
- To raise awareness and encourage proactive solutions to environmental problems.

## Description of the System
The **Community Environmental Monitoring Web App** will have the following functionalities:
- **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in to the platform.
- **Issue Reporting:** Users can report environmental issues by filling out a form with a description, uploading photos, and tagging the location.
- **Map Visualization:** Reported issues will be displayed on an interactive map, allowing users to see the distribution of problems in their area.
- **Community Interaction:** Users can comment on reports to discuss potential solutions and share information.
- **Notifications:** Users will receive notifications about new reports and comments in their area.

## Scope of the System
### Included:
- User registration and authentication.
- Issue reporting with descriptions, photos, and geolocation.
